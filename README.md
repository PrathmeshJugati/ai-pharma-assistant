# 💊 AI Pharma Assistant

An AI-powered pharmaceutical intelligence system that enables semantic medicine search, substitute recommendation, and price comparison using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models.

This project transforms a large Indian medicine dataset into an intelligent assistant capable of understanding natural language queries and recommending equivalent or cheaper medicines.

## 🚀 Motivation

Many medicines share the same active ingredients but are sold under different brand names with large price differences. Patients and pharmacists often struggle to identify affordable alternatives.

This system solves that problem by combining:

- structured pharmaceutical data
- semantic search
- vector databases
- LLM reasoning

✅ Substitute medicine recommendation (composition-based)  
✅ Price comparison across manufacturers  
✅ Semantic retrieval using embeddings  
✅ Conversational AI explanations using LLMs  
✅ Agent-based tool selection (advanced stage)
